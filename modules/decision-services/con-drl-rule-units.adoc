= Rule units in DRL

A DRL rule unit is a module for rules and a unit of execution. A rule unit collects a set of rules with the declaration of the type of facts that the rules act on. A rule unit also serves as a unique namespace for each group of rules. A single rule base can contain multiple rule units. You typically store all the rules for a unit in the same file as the unit declaration so that the unit is self-contained.

The following example is a rule unit designated in a DRL file in a mortgage application decision service:

.Example package definition and rule unit designation in a DRL file
[source]
----
package org.mortgages;
unit MortgageRules;
----

To define a rule unit, you declare the relevant fact types and declare the data sources for the types by implementing the `RuleUnitData` interface, and then define the rules in the unit:

.Example DRL rule unit file
[source]
----
package org.mortgages;
unit MortgageRules;

import org.kie.kogito.rules.DataSource;
import org.kie.kogito.rules.DataStream;

declare Person
    name : String
    dateOfBirth : Date
    address : Address
end

declare MortgageRules extends RuleUnitData
  person: DataStream<Person> = DataSource.createStream()
end

rule "Using a rule unit with a declared type"
  when
    $p : /person[ name == "James" ]
  then   // Insert Mark, who is a customer of James.
    Person mark = new Person();
    mark.setName( "Mark" );
    person.append( mark );
end
----

To separate the fact types from the rule unit for use with other DRL rules, you can declare the types in a separate DRL file and then use the DRL rule file to declare the data sources by using the `RuleUnitData` interface implementation:

.Example DRL type declaration as a separate file
[source]
----
package org.mortgages;

declare Person
    name : String
    dateOfBirth : Date
    address : Address
end
----

.Example DRL rule unit file without explicitly defined types
[source]
----
package org.mortgages;
unit MortgageRules;

import org.kie.kogito.rules.DataSource;
import org.kie.kogito.rules.DataStream;

declare MortgageRules extends RuleUnitData
  person: DataStream<Person> = DataSource.createStream()
end

rule "Using a rule unit with a declared type"
  when
    $p : /person[ name == "James" ]
  then   // Insert Mark, who is a customer of James.
    Person mark = new Person();
    mark.setName( "Mark" );
    person.append( mark );
end
----

In this example, `persons` is a `DataStream` data source for facts of type `Person`. Data sources are typed sources of data that rule units can subscribe to for updates. You interact with the rule unit through the data sources it exposes. A data source can be a `DataStream` source for append-only storage, a `DataStore` source for writable storage to add or remove data, or a `SingletonStore` source for writable storage to set and clear a single element.

As part of your data source declaration, you also import `org.kie.kogito.rules.DataSource` and the relevant data source support, such as `import org.kie.kogito.rules.DataStream` in this example.

You can add several rules to the same DRL file, or further break down the rule set and type declarations by creating more files. However you construct your rule sets, ensure that all DRL rule files exist in the same directory and start with the correct `package` and `unit` declarations.

== Rule unit use case

As an additional rule unit use case, consider the following example decision service that evaluates incoming data from a heat sensor for temperature measurements and produces alerts when the temperature is above a specified threshold.

This example service uses the following `types.drl` file in the `src/main/resources/org/acme` folder of the {PRODUCT} project to declare the `Temperature` and the `Alert` fact types:

.Example DRL type declarations
[source]
----
package com.acme;

declare Temperature
  value: double
end

declare Alert
    severity: String
    message: String
end
----

To define DRL rules that pattern-match against `Temperature` values, the example service must expose an entry point for the incoming data to the {DECISION_ENGINE} and publish alerts on a separate channel. To establish this data source for decision data, the example service uses a rule unit with `DataStream` data sources for `Temperature` objects and for `Alert` objects.

The `DataStream` data source is an append-only store for incoming data, similar to a queue. This type of data source is logical for both sources in this example because the temperature data is coming from an external source (the sensor) and the service publishes the alerts externally as they are produced.

The example service uses the following `MonitoringService.drl` file in the same `src/main/resources/com/acme` folder of the {PRODUCT} project to declare the data sources for the fact types and defines the rules for the rule unit:

.Example DRL rule unit file
[source]
----
package com.acme;
unit MonitoringService;

import org.kie.kogito.rules.DataSource;
import org.kie.kogito.rules.DataStream;

declare MonitoringService extends RuleUnitData
  temperature: DataStream<Temperature> = DataSource.createStream()
  alertData: DataStream<Alert> = DataSource.createStream()
end

rule "tooHot"
when
    $temp : /temperature[value >= 80]
then
    alertData.append(new Alert("HIGH", "Temperature exceeds threshold: " + temp.value));
end
----

The rule unit implements the required `RuleUnitData` interface and declares the data sources for the previously defined types. The sample rule raises an alert when the temperature reaches or exceeds 80 degrees.

== Data sources for DRL rule units

Data sources are typed sources of data that rule units can subscribe to for updates. You interact with the rule unit through the data sources it exposes.

{PRODUCT} supports the following types of data sources. When you declare data sources in DRL rule files, the sources are internally rendered as shown in these examples.

* `DataStream`: An append-only storage option. Use this storage option when you want to publish or share data values. You can use the notation `DataSource.createStream()` to return a `DataStream<T>` object and use the method `append(T)` to add more data.
+
.Example DataStream data source definition
[source,java]
----
DataStream<Temperature> temperature = DataSource.createStream();
// Append value and notify all subscribers
temperature.append(new Temperature(100));
----

* `DataStore`: A writable storage option for adding or removing data and then notifying all subscribers that mutable data has been modified. Rules can pattern-match against incoming values and update or remove available values.



+
.Example DataStore data source definition
[source,java]
----
DataStore<Temperature> temperature = DataSource.createStore();
Temperature temp = new Temperature(100);
// Add value `t` and notify all subscribers
DataHandle t = temperature.add(temp);
temp.setValue(50);
// Notify all subscribers that the value referenced by `t` has changed
temperature.update(t, temp);
// Remove value referenced by `t` and notify all subscribers
temperature.remove(t);
----

* `SingletonStore`: A writable storage option for setting or clearing a single element and then notifying all subscribers that the element has been modified. Rules can pattern-match against the value and update or clear available values.



+
.Example SingletonStore data source definition
[source,java]
----
SingletonStore<Temperature> temperature = DataSource.createSingleton();
Temperature temp = new Temperature(100);
// Add value `temp` and notify all subscribers
temperature.set(temp);
temp.setValue(50);
// Notify all subscribers that the value has changed
temperature.update();

Temperature temp2 = new Temperature(200);
// Overwrite contained value with `temp2` and notify all subscribers
temperature.set(temp2);
temp2.setValue(150);
// Notify all subscribers that the value has changed
temperature.update();

// Clear store and notify all subscribers
temperature.clear();
----

Subscribers to a data source are known as _data processors_. A data processor implements the `DataProcessor<T>` interface. This interface contains callbacks to all the events that a subscribed data source can trigger.

.Example DataStream data processor
[source,java]
----
public interface DataProcessor<T> {
    void insert(DataHandle handle, T object);
    void update(DataHandle handle, T object);
    void delete(DataHandle handle);
}
----

The `DataHandle` method is an internal reference to an object of a data source. Each callaback method might or might not be invoked, depending on whether the corresponding data source implements the capability. For example, a `DataStream` source invokes only the `insert` callback, whereas a `SingletonStore` source invokes the `insert` callback on `set` and the `delete` callback on `clear` or before an overwriting `set`.

== DRL rule unit declaration using Java

As an alternative to declaring fact types and rule units in DRL files, you can also declare types and units using Java classes. In this case, you add the source code to the `src/main/java` folder of your {PRODUCT} project instead of `src/main/resources`.

For example, the following Java classes define the type and rule unit declarations for the example temperature monitoring service:

.Example Temperature class
[source,java]
----
package com.acme;

public class Temperature {
    private final double value;
    public Temperature(double value) { this.value = value; }
    public double getValue() { return value; }
}
----

.Example Alert class
[source,java]
----
package com.acme;

public class Alert {
    private final String severity
    private final String message;
    public Temperature(String severity, String message) {
        this.severity = severity;
        this.message = message;
    }
    public String getSeverity() { return severity; }
    public String getMessage() { return message; }
}
----

.Example rule unit class
[source,java]
----
package com.acme;

import org.kie.kogito.rules.DataSource;
import org.kie.kogito.rules.DataStream;

public class MonitoringService implements RuleUnitData {
    private DataStream<Temperature> temperature = DataSource.createStream();
    private DataStream<Alert> alertData = DataSource.createStream();
    public DataStream<Temperature> getTemperature() { return temperature; }
    public DataStream<Alert> getAlertData() { return alertData; }
}
----

In this scenario, the DRL rule files then stand alone in the `src/main/resources` folder and consist of the `unit` and the rules, with no direct declarations, as shown in the following example:

.Example DRL rule unit file without declarations
[source]
----
package com.acme;
unit MonitoringService;

rule "tooHot"
  when
    $temp : /temperature[value >= 80]
  then
    alertData.append(new Alert("HIGH", "Temperature exceeds threshold: " + temp.value));
end
----

== DRL rule units with BPMN processes

If you use a DRL rule unit as part of a business rule task in a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) process in your {PRODUCT} project, you do not need to create an explicit data type declaration or a rule unit class that implements the `RuleUnitData` interface. Instead, you designate the rule unit in the DRL file as usual and specify the rule unit in the format `unit:__PACKAGE_NAME__.__UNIT_NAME__` in the implementation details for the business rule task in the BPMN process. When you build the project, the business process implicitly declares the rule unit as part of the business rule task to execute the DRL file.

For example, the following is a DRL file with a rule unit designation:

.Example DRL rule unit file
[source]
----
package com.acme;
unit MonitoringService;

rule "tooHot"
  when
    $temp : Temperature( value >= 80 ) from temperature
  then
    alertData.add(new Alert("HIGH", "Temperature exceeds threshold: " + temp.value));
end
----

In the relevant business process in a BPMN 2.0 process modeler, you select the business rule task and for the *Implementation/Execution* property, you set the rule language to `DRL` and the rule flow group to `unit:com.acme.MonitoringService`.

This rule unit syntax specifies that you are using the `com.acme.MonitoringService` rule unit instead of a traditional rule flow group. This is the rule unit that you referenced in the example DRL file. When you build the project, the business process implicitly declares the rule unit as part of the business rule task to execute the DRL file.
