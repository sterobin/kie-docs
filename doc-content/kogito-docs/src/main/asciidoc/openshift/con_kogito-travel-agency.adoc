= Travel agency tutorial for {PRODUCT} services on {OPENSHIFT}

The {PRODUCT} https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-travel-agency-tutorial[travel agency tutorial] in GitHub contains a sequence of example applications with {PRODUCT} services, each of them increasing in complexity. These travel agency applications illustrate many of the advanced configuration options you can use whether you are deploying services locally or on {OPENSHIFT}, such as process persistence with Infinispan, messaging with Kafka, and application data indexing with the Data Index Service.

For more information about each example application, see the `README` file in the relevant application folder.

This tutorial demonstrates the following two related applications:

* `06-kogito-travel-agency`: Application for determining travel plans
* `06-kogito-visas`: Application for managing travel visas, if required

These two applications communicate through events. The travel agency service sends visa applications for travelers that require visas to visit a given country, and based on a visa application evaluation, the visa service responds with the visa approval or rejection.

The applications expose REST API endpoints that are generated from the Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 (BPMN2) business process definitions in the services. Internally, the applications communicate using Apache Kafka messaging. The logic to interact with Kafka to produce and consume messages is also generated from the BPMN2 process definitions.
