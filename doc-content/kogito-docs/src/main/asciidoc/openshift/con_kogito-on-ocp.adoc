= {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}

You can deploy {PRODUCT} services on {OPENSHIFT} for cloud implementation. In this solution, {PRODUCT} services are deployed as OpenShift pods that you can scale up and down individually to provide as few or as many containers as required for a particular service. You can use standard OpenShift methods to manage the pods and balance the load.

To help you deploy your services on OpenShift, {PRODUCT} provides the following resources:

* *{PRODUCT} Operator*: An operator that guides you through the deployment process. The {PRODUCT} Operator uses the https://github.com/operator-framework[Operator Framework] and automates many of the deployment steps for you. For example, you can provide the Operator a link to the Git repository that contains your application, and the operator can check out the project, build it (including native compilation, if applicable), and deploy the resulting services.
* *{PRODUCT} command-line interface (CLI)*: A CLI tool that enables you to interact with the {PRODUCT} Operator for deployment tasks. The {PRODUCT} CLI also enables you to deploy {PRODUCT} services from source instead of relying on custom resources and YAML files. You can use the {PRODUCT} CLI as a command-line alternative for deploying {PRODUCT} services without the {OPENSHIFT} web console.
