= Deploying {PRODUCT} services on {OPENSHIFT} using the {PRODUCT} CLI

The {PRODUCT} command-line interface (CLI) enables you to interact with the {PRODUCT} Operator for deployment tasks. The {PRODUCT} CLI also enables you to deploy {PRODUCT} services from source instead of relying on custom resources and YAML files. You can use the {PRODUCT} CLI as a command-line alternative for deploying {PRODUCT} services without the {OPENSHIFT} web console.

.Prerequisites
* The `oc` OpenShift CLI is installed. For `oc` installation instructions, see the
ifdef::KOGITO[]
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.2/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc[OpenShift documentation].
endif::[]
ifdef::KOGITO-COMM[]
https://docs.okd.io/latest/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#cli-reference-get-started-cli[OpenShift documentation].
endif::[]
* You have OpenShift permissions to create resources in a given namespace.

.Procedure
. Download the latest version of the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-cloud-operator/releases[Kogito Operator distribution] from GitHub.
. Extract the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-RELEASE` binary file:
+
--
* On Linux: In a command terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-RELEASE` binary file and run the following command to extract the contents:
+
.Extract the {PRODUCT} Operator distribution
[source]
----
tar -xvf kogito-RELEASE.tar.gz
----

* On Windows: In your file browser, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `{PRODUCT_INIT}-RELEASE` binary file and extract the ZIP file.

The `kogito` executable file appears.
--
. Move the extracted `{PRODUCT_INIT}` file to an existing directory in your `PATH` variable, such as `/usr/local/bin`:
+
--
* On Linux: In a command terminal, run the following command:
+
.Move the `{PRODUCT_INIT}` file
[source]
----
cp /PATH_TO_KOGITO /usr/local/bin
----

* On Windows: In your file browser, move the extracted directory to the new location.
--
. With the {PRODUCT} CLI now installed, run the following commands to deploy your {PRODUCT} services on OpenShift from source:
+
--
.Example {PRODUCT} service deployment from existing namespace
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
# Uses the provisioned namespace in your OpenShift cluster
$ kogito use-project PROJECT_NAME

# Deploys a new {PRODUCT} service from source
$ kogito deploy-service example-quarkus https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples --context-dir jbpm-quarkus-example
----

NOTE: The first time that you use the {PRODUCT} CLI to interact with a project or service, the {PRODUCT} Operator is automatically installed and used to execute the relevant tasks.

Alternatively, you can generate a new namespace in your cluster during deployment:

.Example {PRODUCT} service deployment from new namespace
[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
# Creates a new namespace in your cluster
$ kogito new-project NEW_PROJECT_NAME

# Deploys a new {PRODUCT} service from source
$ kogito deploy-service example-quarkus https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples --context-dir jbpm-quarkus-example
----

You can also use the following abbreviated syntax for service deployment:

.Abbreviated command for {PRODUCT} service deployment
[source]
----
$ kogito deploy-service example-quarkus https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples --context-dir jbpm-quarkus-example --project PROJECT_NAME
