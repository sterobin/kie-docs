= Creating an OpenShift project and installing the {PRODUCT} Operator using the {PRODUCT} CLI

To set up an example {PRODUCT} application for deployment on {OPENSHIFT}, you must create a project (namespace) in OpenShift in which you can install the application and the {PRODUCT} Operator. The {PRODUCT} Operator uses the https://github.com/operator-framework[Operator Framework] and automates many of the deployment steps for you. The first time that you use the {PRODUCT} CLI to interact with a project or service, the {PRODUCT} Operator is automatically installed and used to execute the relevant tasks.

You can create the project and install the {PRODUCT} Operator using the OpenShift web console or using the {PRODUCT} CLI. This example uses the {PRODUCT} CLI.

.Procedure
. In a command terminal, with the `oc` CLI connected to your OpenShift environment, enter the following command to create the OpenShift project:
+
.Creating the OpenShift project
[source]
----
$ oc new-project kogito-travel-agency --display-name="Kogito Travel Agency" --description="Kogito Travel Agency application."
----
. Enter the following command to connect the new project to the {PRODUCT} CLI tooling:
+
--
.Connecting to the new project
[source]
----
$ kogito use-project
Project set to 'kogito-travel-agency'
----

[NOTE]
====
If you do not have `cluster-admin` permissions and another user created the `kogito-travel-agency` project for you, enter the following command to connect to the existing project:

[source]
----
kogito use-project kogito-travel-agency
----
====

The `kogito use-project` command also automatically installs the following components:

* *{PRODUCT} Operator*: Provides automation for deployment on OpenShift
* *Infinispan Operator*: Provides persistence infrastructure for {PRODUCT} services
* *Strimzi Operator*: Provides messaging infrastructure for {PRODUCT} services
* *Keycloak Operator*: Provides security and single sign-on infrastructure for {PRODUCT} services

After you create the OpenShift project and install the {PRODUCT} Operator using the {PRODUCT} CLI, the operator is also listed in the OpenShift web console in *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
