// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a developer of business decisions, you can use {PRODUCT} business automation to develop decision services using Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models, Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules, XLS or XLSX spreadsheet decision tables, or a combination of all three methods.

// Modules - concepts, procedures, refs, etc.

== Decision-authoring assets in {PRODUCT}

{PRODUCT} supports several assets that you can use to define business decisions for your decision service. Each decision-authoring asset has different advantages, and you might prefer to use one or a combination of multiple assets depending on your goals and needs.

The following table highlights the main decision-authoring assets supported in {PRODUCT} projects to help you decide or confirm the best method for defining decisions in your decision service.

|Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models
a|
* Are decision models based on a notation standard defined by the Object Management Group (OMG)
* Use graphical decision requirements diagrams (DRDs) with one or more decision requirements graphs (DRGs) to trace business decision flows
* Use an XML schema that allows the DMN models to be shared between DMN-compliant platforms
* Support Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) to define decision logic in DMN decision tables and other DMN boxed expressions
* Can be integrated efficiently with Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) process models
* Are optimal for creating comprehensive, illustrative, and stable decision flows
|{PRODUCT} DMN modeler in VSCode or other DMN-compliant editor
|xref:con-dmn_dmn-models[]

|DRL rules
a|
* Are individual rules that you define directly in `.drl` text files
* Provide the most flexibility for defining rules and other technicalities of rule behavior
* Are optimal for creating rules that require advanced DRL options, such as rule units
* Have strict syntax requirements for rules to be compiled properly
|Any integrated development environment (IDE)
|xref:con-drl_drl-rules[]

|Spreadsheet decision tables
a|
* Are tabular sets of rules that you define in `.xls` or `.xlsx` spreadsheet files
* Support template keys and values for creating rule templates
* Are optimal for business environments that already rely on decision tables for rules
* Have strict syntax requirements for rules to be compiled properly when used in {PRODUCT}

//@Jason: The following `{asciidoc-dir}` functions as a symlink for both enterprise (document attribute) and community (pom.xml attribute) so that we can house chaps in subject-matter dirs and still cross-ref like this to other chaps in other folders. The docs are already doing this sort of thing for artifacts and images, so just following suite.
