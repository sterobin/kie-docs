= Running a {PRODUCT} service

After you design the business decisions and processes for your {PRODUCT} service, you can run your Quarkus or Spring Boot application in one of the following modes:

* *Development mode*: For local testing. On Quarkus, development mode also offers live reload of your processes and rules in your running applications for advanced debugging.
* *JVM mode*: For compatibility with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
* *Native mode*: (Quarkus only, requires GraalVM) For direct binary execution as native code.

.Procedure
