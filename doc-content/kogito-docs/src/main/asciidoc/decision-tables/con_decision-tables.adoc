= Spreadsheet decision tables

Spreadsheet decision tables are XLS or XLSX spreadsheet files that contain business rules defined in a tabular format. You can include spreadsheet decision tables as part of your {PRODUCT} project. Each row in a decision table is a rule, and each column is a condition, an action, or another rule attribute. After you create and include your spreadsheet decision tables in your project, the rules you defined are compiled into Drools Rule Language (DRL) rules for the decision service.
