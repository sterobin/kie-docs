= Extended type declarations in DRL

DRL supports type declaration inheritance in the format `declare __FACT_TYPE_1__ extends __FACT_TYPE_2__`. To extend a type declared in Java by a subtype declared in DRL, you repeat the parent type in a declaration statement without any fields.

For example, the following type declarations extend a `Student` type from a top-level `Person` type, and a `LongTermStudent` type from the `Student` subtype:

.Example extended type declarations

----
import org.people.Person

declare Person end

declare Student extends Person
    school : String
end

declare LongTermStudent extends Student
    years : int
    course : String
end
